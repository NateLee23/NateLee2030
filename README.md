# ELV Optimization & Digital Twin Projects

Welcome to my GitHub! This repository showcases my work in **End-of-Life Vehicle (ELV) optimization**, **market data mining**, and **digital twins** for the automotive industry.

## 🚗 **About Me**

I'm passionate about leveraging **data analytics** and **digital technologies** to streamline scrapyard operations, predict part values, and enhance the sustainability of vehicle life cycles. I use a mix of **Python**, **SQL**, **NLP**, **web scraping**, and **data visualization** to solve complex problems and create smarter solutions.

## 📊 **What’s Here**

This repository contains various projects focused on:

- **Operational Analytics**: Streamlining scrapyard logistics, tracking parts, and optimizing vehicle dismantling.
- **Market Data Mining**: Predicting part values, analyzing resale insights, and tracking demand trends.
- **Digital Twin Models**: Exploring ways to model and optimize the ELV lifecycle using digital twin technology.

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **SQL**
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**
- **Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)**
- **Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)**

## 📈 **How to Contribute**

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Contributions to improving scrapyard operations or exploring ELV-related analytics are always welcome!
